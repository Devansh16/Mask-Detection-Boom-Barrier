With the cities ready to reopen post the pandemic there is still a requirement to follow social distancing, wearing masks and other preventive measures. The mask detection boom barrier prevents people not following these norms from entering into public places like metros, malls, shops, restaurants, institutes while eliminating the involvement of security staff to deal with such people who could be a potential carrier of the virus. This ensures the safety of staff and other people in the public spaces, making public places a safer place. 

Since the solution uses components of Internet of Things this can further be used to generate data and and do real life monitoring of how safe a particular place is, enabling people to decide if and when they wanna go to that place.
